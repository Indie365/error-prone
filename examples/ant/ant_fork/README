This example runs the version of the ant integration that forks Error Prone
into a different process.  To run:

1) Go into the error-prone/ant directory and run "mvn package" to build the
   error_prone_ant snapshot jar.

2) Download the latest verson of our javac jar from Maven Central into this 
   directory.  The latest version is available under:
   https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/errorprone/javac/

Now you should be able to build by typing "ant" at the prompt.
